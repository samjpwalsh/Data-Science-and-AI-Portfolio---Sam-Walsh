This portfolio provides a brief description of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence projects that I have completed. Each project title links to it's repository, which houses the code and more in depth information about the project. 

# Data Science Projects:

## Product Review Opinion Mining

    - NLP task to extract product features and assign positive or negative sentiment to those features.
    - Data source is Amazon reviews of various products
    - Spacy's NLP pipeline was used to first pre-process the data then identify nouns and noun phrases (potential features) along with adjectives (likely sentiment bearing)
    - Features pruned using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
    - Sentiment analysed using Naive Bayes classification
    - The final output are product summaries, consisting of the extracted features and aggregate sentiment towards those features
    - The approach taken here was inspired by Hu and Liu, 2004 (https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/publications/kdd04-revSummary.pdf)
